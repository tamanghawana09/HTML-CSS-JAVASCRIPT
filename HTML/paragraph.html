        <p>This is a Paragraph.
            However we write the paragaraph      whether
            there is space or not the webpage ignores it.

        <hr>
        <p>Here, this paragraph has used a horizontal rule which creates a horizontal line
            to the text<br> The horizontal rule also seperates the content <br> Only the break tag is used to break the line in the paragraph.
        </p>

        <pre>
            This is a preformatted text or paragraph.
            
            Where the written texts are displayed in a fixed - width font

            and it preserves both the spaces and line breaks.
