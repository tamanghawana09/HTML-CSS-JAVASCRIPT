# Using The id Attribute
The <em>id</em> attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the <em>
id</em> attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
The <em>id</em> attribute is used to pointt to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces{}.
This is because ids are used to identify elements when they appear in JavaScript code, and it's important.
