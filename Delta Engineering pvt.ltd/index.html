            <h2>BARBED WIRE</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Concertina Barbed Wire in roll form is used to high security areas to deter trespassing men and animals. The effectiveness of this material <br>
            is proved as it has been in use for more than 75 years during war and peace.</p>
            <h3 id="line">Line Wire:</h3>
            <p>This is made up of 3.05 mm diameter high carbon steel wire, with a tensile strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm<sup>2</sup>. The wire is drawn and dressed in 
            such a manner that the coils formed will fall <br> naturally into the specified diameter without forming a figure eight. Line wire is heavy hot dipped galvanized with minimum zinc coating of 185 gm/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
            <h3 id="line">Barbed Wire:</h3>
            <p>This is 2.00 diameter bright mild steel wire with a tensile strength of 38 to 55kg/mm<sup>2</sup> conforming to BS 1052. The wire is hot dipped galvanized with a minimum zinc coating<br>
            of 20 t0 50 gm/mm <sup>2</sup>. The barbs are formed with four points. Spacing between the centers of the barbs is every 70mm along the length of the wire. The barbs are firmly secured <br>
            by indentations made on the wire. </p>
            <h3 id ="line">Carrying Handles:</h3>
            <p>Handles are made of mild steel wire of 3.55mm diameter and are attached to the outer turn of the coil on each side.</p>

            <h2>BARBED TAPES</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Barbed Tapes are used as psychological and physical deterrent against intrusion by personnel and animals. Barbed tape barrier systems are more vicious and difficult to tamper <br> with, providing superior
            perimeter security. Some of the users are military installations, nuclear energy sites, maximum-security prisons, various petroleum installations, tank farms and other important<br> industrial facilities.</p>
            <h3 id="line">Short Blade Barbed Tape:</h3>
            <p>To give the maximum tensile strength at the time of the breach hard drawn steel cord is used (ES1). For camouflage purposes, a coaltar coating can be applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and to attain the high degree  of rust resistance, the core wire is made
            of galvanized  steel (ES-2). Any of the above three options are available to meet your specific requirements. There are several variations in spiral diameter in accordance with the needs of the customers.</p>
            <h3 id="line">Medium Blade Barbed Tape (MBBT) : </h3>
            <p>The specification of the "ivory" tape is similar to those of ES types. However the blades are sharper and have a greater pricking capacity. This can be used for both temporary and permanent security.<br>
            The life of this tape is more than three times longer than those of ES types. Therefore, "ivory" tape is a more effective choice in terrain, which has heavy rain or in coastal areas.</p>
            <h3 id="line">Long Blade Barbed Tape (LBBT) : </h3>
            <p>This is the most effective psychological and physical deterrent, ever made as a barrier obstacle. It is available in stainless steel (SUS430) and the core wire can be fabricated<br> from either
            galvanized carbon steel or stainless steel.</p>

            <h2>ANIMAL FENCING</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> DEPL's animal fencing system is mainly used as an anti-intrusion barrier against any farm and other animals.</p>
            <p>The most common use is on highways where vast distances are covered at a very economical cost.</p>
            <p>Animal fencing can also be used to enclose areas such as farms, forest areas and national parks, where security is not crucial.</p>
            <p>This system is easy to install and an be erected in a comparatively short time.</p>
